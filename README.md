# Twilight
Twilight is a game created as a group project for my Intro to Software Engineering class. This game was made with LibGDX. The following people worked on this project:
* Sean Maidana Dollanarte
* Steven Borck
* Chris East
* Tim Lima


# Where are the files located? 
LibGDX is cross-platform, so a lot of folders get created. To view the Java files we worked on, navigate to 

[twilight-game/Twilight/core/src/main/java/com/onethirdbetter/twilight/](https://github.com/gcmaidana/twilight-game/tree/master/Twilight/core/src/main/java/com/onethirdbetter/twilight)

# Running the program
To run the program, run the JAR file, Twilight.JAR
Feel free to try to run the program in an IDE but it may be a pain to set up because of all the cofigurations you may need.
I suggest just running the JAR file, as it is easiest.

If you chose to run the program, rather than the JAR file then here is some notes we made when we finished this project:

1. Make sure you have a JRE installed, it doesn't really matter which one, just as long as you have it.

2. Have to have a JDK that supports Gradle. We have been using JDK 11.
  
3. Set the run configuration to this. JDK->your version (11 recommended), class path->Twilight.lwjgl3.main, main class->com.onethirdbetter.twilight.lwjgl3.Lwjgl3Launcher.

4. Hit apply and ok.

5. Make sure your run configuration is selected, then build and run.

6. Play the game.
