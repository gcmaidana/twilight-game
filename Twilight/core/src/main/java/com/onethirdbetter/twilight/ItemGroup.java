  //but then we can add items to an item group and check if the groups are equal to see if something can be crafted
  //otherwise if you want to just make an item list on the spot then that may be simpler
  //so i left this kind of barebones right now because there are so many ways we can do it
  //but you can just ignore this if you have no idea what I was thinking and have a better idea on how to do it
