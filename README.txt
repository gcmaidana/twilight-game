1. Make sure you have a JRE installed, it doesn't really matter which one, just as long as you have it.

2. If step two did not work, you might have to run the program through the compliler. To do this, you just have to have a JDK that supports Gradle. We have been using JDK 11.
   If step two did work, you can ignor the rest of the steps.

3. Set the run configuration to this. JDK->your version (11 recommended), class path->Twilight.lwjgl3.main, main class->com.onethirdbetter.twilight.lwjgl3.Lwjgl3Launcher.

4. Hit apply and ok.

5. Make sure your run configuration is selected, then build and run.

6. Play the game.
